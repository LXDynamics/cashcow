## Test Execution Strategy

### Development Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
poetry run pytest

# Run specific test categories
poetry run pytest tests/test_models.py        # Unit tests
poetry run pytest tests/test_integration.py  # Integration tests
poetry run pytest tests/test_performance.py  # Performance tests

# Run with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=cashcow

# Run specific patterns
poetry run pytest -k "employee"              # Employee-related tests
poetry run pytest -k "performance"           # Performance tests only
```

### Continuous Integration
```bash
# Pre-commit hooks (run automatically)
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files

# Full test suite with quality checks
poetry run black src/ tests/           # Code formatting
poetry run ruff --fix src/ tests/      # Linting
poetry run mypy src/                   # Type checking
poetry run pytest --cov=cashcow        # Tests with coverage
```

### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Memory profiling
poetry run python -m memory_profiler tests/test_memory_profiling.py

# Performance benchmarks
poetry run pytest tests/test_parallel_benchmarks.py -v

# Stress testing
poetry run pytest tests/test_performance.py::test_large_dataset_performance
```

## Test Data Management

### Test Fixtures
- **Minimal Entities**: Basic required fields only
- **Complete Entities**: All optional fields populated
- **Edge Case Data**: Zero values, extreme dates, missing fields
- **Large Datasets**: 100+ entities for performance testing

### Test Environment
- **Isolated**: Each test uses temporary directories and databases
- **Reproducible**: Fixed random seeds for Monte Carlo tests
- **Cleanup**: Automatic teardown of test resources
- **Concurrent**: Tests can run in parallel safely

## Quality Metrics & Coverage Requirements

### Code Coverage Targets
- **Unit Tests**: 95%+ coverage for core business logic
- **Integration Tests**: 85%+ coverage for workflow paths
- **Performance Tests**: Key bottlenecks and scaling limits

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before merge
- Code coverage must not decrease
- Performance benchmarks must meet thresholds
- Memory usage must remain within limits
- Type checking must pass without errors

## Maintenance & Best Practices

### Test Maintenance
- **Regular Updates**: Keep tests aligned with feature changes
- **Refactoring**: Maintain test code quality alongside production code
- **Documentation**: Clear test descriptions and expected outcomes
- **Performance Baselines**: Update benchmarks as system evolves

### Best Practices
1. **Test Independence**: Each test should be self-contained
2. **Clear Naming**: Test names should describe what is being tested
3. **Single Responsibility**: One test per logical unit
4. **Fast Execution**: Unit tests should run quickly
5. **Deterministic**: Tests should not rely on external state
6. **Error Messages**: Clear failure messages for debugging

### Debugging Failed Tests
```bash
# Verbose output
poetry run pytest -v

# Stop on first failure
poetry run pytest -x

# Run specific test with debugging
poetry run pytest tests/test_models.py::TestEmployee::test_salary_calculation -v -s

# Enable pytest debugging
poetry run pytest --pdb
```
