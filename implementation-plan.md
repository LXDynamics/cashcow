# Cash Flow Modeling System - Implementation Plan

## Instructions for Agents

1. **Before starting any task**, verify all prerequisites are checked off
2. **Mark tasks complete** by changing `[ ]` to `[x]` when finished
3. **Add notes** under each task if needed (errors, decisions, etc.)
4. **Create the specified files** in the correct directories
5. **Run tests** after implementing each component

## Project Overview

A flexible cash flow modeling system for a rocket engine company using:
