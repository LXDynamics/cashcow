## Key Architectural Insights

### 1. Clean Architecture Implementation
- **Layered Design**: Clear separation between UI, business logic, and data
- **Dependency Direction**: Dependencies point inward toward core business logic
- **Abstraction**: Interfaces separate concerns and enable testability

### 2. Plugin-Based Extensibility
- **Calculator Registry**: Central plugin management system
- **Decorator Pattern**: Simple plugin registration with `@register_calculator`
- **Dependency Management**: Automatic resolution of calculator dependencies
- **Runtime Discovery**: Dynamic plugin loading and execution

### 3. Flexible Data Modeling
- **Schema Flexibility**: Pydantic models with `extra='allow'` for future extensibility
- **Entity Factory**: Centralized creation with type resolution
- **Validation Framework**: Real-time validation with file watchers

### 4. Performance Optimization
- **Multi-mode Execution**: Synchronous, asynchronous, and parallel processing
- **Intelligent Caching**: Memory-based result caching with cache invalidation
- **Dual Storage**: YAML for human editing, SQLite for performance

### 5. Configuration-Driven Behavior
- **Entity Type Definitions**: Configurable entity types with associated calculators
- **KPI Definitions**: Flexible performance metric configuration
- **Scenario Management**: Multiple financial scenario support

## Technical Excellence Indicators
